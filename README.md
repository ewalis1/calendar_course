# calendar_course

This is project that I made to pass the course JavaScript Developer, organised by an IT school - Coders Lab. 
In this project I used React to create page, where you can reverve a date from calendar if you want to train with a bike trainer 
from Bikeszkola.
I used Moment.JS to create a whole calendar and a Bootstrap to make this page responsive.
In this app is also a form which helps you to reserve a date.
I created fake REST API, all reservations based on sent forms are saved in JSON server and then reserved dates are displayed on a sceen. 
I'm still working on this project. I want to add few more things and make it look and work even better.
